            <p>
				Can we enjoy these amazingly beautiful islands and be more
				mindful of our consumption and waste? We say "Yes"! We divert food waste and other organics, before they get to our landfill and use them as valuable sources of inputs for our compost. Win Win!!! Our <strong class="red">Mission</strong> is to initiate and collaborate on projects that inspire sustainability, especially urban gardening, primarily in, but not limited to, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.  Our <strong class="green">Vision</strong> is to be a model in the Caribbean for creative sustainable solutions and to help food and beverage outlets on the island of St. Thomas reduce their compostable waste to landfill by 50% by June, 2025. </p>

<!-- THIS SECTION IS TO <div>We need help to bring our vision to fruition. We will need or at least have access to several specialized vehicles and  land to build a specialized industrial composting site and adjacent facilities. We will need collaboration and cooperation from private and public sector entities to obtain safe and quality inputs. There will be plenty of work to be done, and we will need funds to pay our associates as they work to make this vision a reality. Please contact us for general inquiries or if you would like to get involved. If you are already engaged in similar work and would like to collaborate, we would love to hear about your project.</div>  -->
