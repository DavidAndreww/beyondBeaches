            <p>Methane, a greenhouse gas that damages our ozone, is a major culprit in global warming. Approximately 20% of global methane production is a result of food waste and other organic materials rotting amidst non-organic materials in anaerobic landfills. We are a small operation and are setting ourselves up for success. Currently, we are partnering with cafes and restaurants in Havensight area in St. Thomas to rescue valuable food waste from our landfill and use it as inputs in compost for our organic garden in Frenchman Bay. It is our mission to educate and inspire Virgin Islanders on the potential for a more sustainable future. Our vision is to support, grow, and connect the community of people and organizations who are already engaged in this work and to greatly reduce the amount of organic waste that enters our landfill, by working with food and beverage outlets and resorts to establish more composting sites, including an industrial aerated static pile composting operation on the island.  Please contact us if you would like to get involved in this project. We would love for you to join us. We will need co-creators, volunteers, and business sponsors who are willing to share their time and resources to grow and maintain this project</p>
