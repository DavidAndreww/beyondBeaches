            <h3 class="green">Havensight Area Composting Program</h3>
            <p>Methane, a greenhouse gas that damages our ozone, is a major culprit in global warming. Approximately 20% of global methane production is a result of food waste and other organic materials rotting amidst non-organic materials in anaerobic landfills. We are a small operation and are setting ourselves up for success. By thinking globally and acting locally, we endeavor to make a  important albeit small contribution to reducing greenhouse gas production, where we can. Currently, we are partnering with cafes and restaurants in Havensight area in St. Thomas to rescue valuable food waste from our landfill and use it as inputs in compost for our organic garden in Frenchman Bay. It is our <strong>Mission</strong> to educate and inspire Virgin Islanders and our visitors on the potential for a more sustainable future. Our <strong>Vision </strong> is to support, grow, and connect the community of people and organizations who are already engaged in this work. Working with food and beverage outlets and resorts, we will reduce the amount of organic waste that enters our landfill. We will promote urban gardening, farm to table/boat initiatives, and provide educational opportunities for youth and adults. We would love for you to join us on this journey. We will need co-creators, stewards, volunteers, and business sponsors who are willing to share their time and resources to maintain and expand this community. Please contact us if you would like to get involved. </p>
